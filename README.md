# Shortly-Express

Shortly is a URL shortener service similar to Bitly - but is only partially finished. The goal is to build out an authentication system and other features that will enable users to have their own private set of shortened URLs.

Think about how to approach authentication from both a user perspective and a technical perspective. Some questions to think about:

- [] What additonal steps will the user need to take when interacting with the application? More specifically, what additional routes will the application need to handle?
- [] What strategies do I need to employ to secure existing site funcitonality?
- [] How often should the user need to enter their username + password?
